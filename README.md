# Paragon Ping System
I loved the way of pinging allies back when playing Paragon (the closed Epic Games' game) so I decided to recreate it.

This is just a (complete and perfect :smirk:) simulation of the ping system, placed above a video of gameplay.

* If you want to build it yourself, you will have to download the video file from my Dropbox because the file was too big. Please go in the "Assets" folder, and follow the instructions [in the text file](https://github.com/Drarig29/ParagonPingSystem/blob/master/ParagonPingSystem/Assets/%5BRGSACE%5D%20Paragon%20Gideon%20Gameplay%20-%20THE%20COSMIC%20MONSTER.txt).
* If you don't want to, but still want to try it to remember those good feelings, you can also [download the release](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3w28vvv12doqe0l/paragonpingsystem.zip?dl=0).
